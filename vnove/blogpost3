VeNove Knot dress polka dots
Almost all the dresses in VeNove collection are made out of stretchy jersey fabrics. This dress however is made of cotton without elastane. I designed a dress that is comfortable and suitable for the pregnant siluette, although the material is not stretchy.  My goal was to design a beautiful maternity dress that at first glance doesn't look as a typical pregnancy and nursing  garment.  
Now a few more words about this dress:

I wanted to make a slightly fitted upper bodice and a pretty A-shape to the hem line. The waist line ist slightly higher than usual - in this way the siluette is beautifully balanced and there is enough room for the growing belly.
The front hem is pleated - thanks to the pleats the dress is very comfortable and looks well also worn as a “normal” garment after the pregnancy. The front hem is also a bit longer than the back hem - because of this small adjustment it doesn’t get too short when the belly grows.

On the back bodice there are waist darts, which give beutiful shape to the siluette. My goal was to make a dress that is quite fitted and doesn’t look like a tent :-)
There is a knot on the front panel of the dress. Thanks to it the overall design is more interesting, but it’s also a very practical element. When you open the knot it gives you access to the hidden breasfeeding panel.

This dress has a round neckline which makes the siluette look lighter, especially when the breast size gets bigger. Thanks to this neckline it’s also easy to wear the dress without a zipper.

The dress is fully lined with very soft and light viscose-elastane jersey. Thanks to the lining it is very comfortable and it fits nicely on the body.

And of course it has pockets :-)
